# Reflection

In this assignment you've learned very basic HTML and CSS, the content and presentation layers of the web. Take this opportunity to think about how they might relate to your work as a historian. 

## Question 1 (150 words)
#### In Part 2, we explored the use of semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<article>`, and `<section>`. These elements make it easier for machines and non-visual browsers to navigate web pages. Why might this be important? (You might want to Google around a bit before answering!)
The semantics that make it easier for machines and non-visual browsers to understand the web pages are important for accessibility. Often some form of text to speech can help with accesibility, but the issue is all the more apparent as more as more communication shifts to the internet. The internet a very visual medium with images and text often being so closely linked that just reading the text would lose out on much of the meaning. Alt displays of information allow for non-visual browsers to better convey information, by reading descriptions of images, and the tages help provide a structure to the text that would be apparent in a visual medium but absent in a non-visual browser. This all helps make the internet more accessible for all. 


## Question 2 (150 words)
#### In your CSS work, you learned how to change the presentation of material on the web without changing the content. Using a pen and paper, a drawing program, or (if you're feeling ambitious) real HTML and CSS, mock up 2 very different presentations of the information you displayed in your post. Put images of them on the Internet somewhere (but not in this repository) and link to them here. Write a brief paragraph discussing the effect of the presentaiton layer on the reader.
The first variant puts the portrait right in the center of the page with the title, text and sources flanking the portrait on either side. This is certainly more visually interesting, with the portrait able to draw attention to the page in a way other forms would not. However, it also has its downsides due to the size of the portrait. The webpage would likely need to be widened considerably or the text would need to be quite narrow and long. Both would inconvenience the reader. The other variant is the alternate of that, being quite narrow and well suited to smaller (cell phone) screens, but would look quite awkward on most desktop browsers. On the other hand, it also keeps the next in order nicely and prevents it from being squished by giving it a row to itself.
