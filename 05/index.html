        <p>Lester Pearson had two careers, rising to the top in both: diplomat and politician. </p> 
        <p>He first entered the Canadian Foreign Service in the 1920’s and remained there until 1948. In that time he was on the front lines of some of the defining moments of the early 20th century. He witnessed Canada’s first attempts to exercise an independent foreign policy from Britain against the backdrop of the failure of the league of nations and appeasement. He worked at the high commission in London during the Blitz and was later assigned to Washington as the center of the post-war world shifted across the Atlantic. He helped design international institutions like the United Nations and NATO before entering politics as the Liberal Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1948. He won a Nobel Prize in that role in 1957 after developing a peacekeeping force as a solution for the Suez Crisis. </p>
        <p>He was elected Leader of the Liberal Party in 1957 and Prime Minister in 1963. His 5 years as Prime Minister saw several major accomplishments including introduction of the Canadian Health Care system and the current flag and he kept Canada out of the Vietnam War. He retired in 1968 and was succeeded by Pierre Trudeau. He died in 1972.</p>
